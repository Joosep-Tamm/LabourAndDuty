Labour and Duty is a virtual reality rhythm game for Meta Quest VR headsets made in Unity. The game was made as the Bachelor thesis work of Joosep Tamm. The goals when making the game were to provide a novel and original game experience, especially to those familiar with VR and its rhythm game selection. Additionally several steps were taken in Labour and Duty's design process to prevent or mitigate VR related issues like cyber sickness and overheating.

Here's a short video demonstrating Labour and Duty's gameplay and relevant systems.
